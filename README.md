# Introduction
EVEmu modified to support the latest Escalation to Inferno client v365966

# Disclaimer

***EVEmu is an educational project.***
 This means, our primary interest is to learn and teach us
and our users more about C++ project development in a large
scale. Our software is not intended for running public servers,
and we do not support that. We are not responsible for what others
do with the source code downloaded from this project.

# Status
- Login still works!
- Character selection and creation is still working
- Character portraits are still working
- Undocking is not working, but docking is still working
- Items and Ships still display in station
- Destiny is still nearly fully functional if you are undocked
